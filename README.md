# Wumpus_world_game
Enhanced Wumpus World reimagines the classic maze challenge. Navigate a grid with hidden pits and Wumpuses using manual controls or an AI agent (with BFS and logic). The Tkinter GUI displays score, position, and hazards, while iteration mode simulates games and logs win rates and scores.
